    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There's no need for complexity, this dish is a cassarole made exclusively from Hashbrown, alright, not quite.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p><ul>
    <li><strong>Frozen Hashbrowns</strong>: You'll want to thaw these.</li>
    <li><strong>Canned Soup</strong>: Cream of some sort sort, be it chicken or mushroom.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheddar</strong>: or anything cheese like that'll melt</li>
    <li><strong>Sour Cream</strong>: 8 ozs needed, vegan is just as well</li>
    <li><strong>Butter</strong>: 1 stick or 1/2-3/4 cups of a substitute</li>
    <li><strong>Onion</strong>: 1/2 cup chopped</li>
    <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: Salt and ground black pepper for starts. Nutritional Yeast and cumin to add some pungent cheesiness. Get creative with it!</li>
    <li><strong>Cornflakes</strong>: A cup crushed to top</li>
    <p>I've actually never made this recipe, I'm copying it from <a href=https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/276505/grandmas-hash-brown-casserole/>All Recipes</a> for the sake of learning HTML but I imagine it's delicious </p>
</ul></p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat over to 350 and gather ingredients</li>
        <li>Mix all except cornflakes and transfer to 9x13 caserole dish</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cornflakes on top and drizzle a little extra oil/fat that wasn't actually accounted for in the ingredients</li>
        <li>Bake 1-1 1/2 hours, look for the sauce to be bubbling and the top to be golden brown</li>
        <li>It's done, do with it what you will</li>
    </ol>
