    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Once again, Delicious and simple protein in the morning, or even for lunch! Tuna Salad on cheese on bagel. Open faced or it'll all squeeze out.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p><ul>
    <li><strong>A Bagel</strong>: I use a plain bagel</li>
    <li><strong>2 Slices of Cheese of Choice</strong>: I prefer sliced cheese to cover the hole in the bagel. I use American as it's kept stocked in my fridge. Creativity welcomed!</li>
    <li><strong>A Can of Tuna</strong>: You can split one can between the two halves. I give a little bit of it to my cats and still have enough leftover.</li>
    <li><strong>Mayo</strong>: A good blob of it, the more the less the tuna will hold it's structure.</li>
    <li><strong>Spices</strong>: I use basil, plenty of salt, pepper, a little squirt of sriracha, and a little squirt of lemon juice but all of this is optional and you can be creative here.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Tuna and add to a bowl, mix with mayo and spices.</li>
        <li>Toast bagel</li>
        <li>Place slice of cheese on each face of the bagel</li>
        <li>Glob the Tuna Salad on top of the cheese</li>
        <li>Microwave if you want, or each it as is</li>
    </ol>
